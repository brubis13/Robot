# Test Execution

## Purpose:
To learn how to execute specific tests based upon tags

## Learning Objectives:
- Trainees will be able to define what a tag is
- Trainees will be able to execute tests by including or excluding tags
- Trainees will be able to state several uses of tags and how they may be organized to get those uses

## Challenge:
Using tags execute the following groups of tests:
- Only the smoke tests
- Only the regression tests
- Only known issue #27
- All known issues
- Ignore the known failing tests
- Both the smoke and regression tests

## Extra Credit:
Designate a test as one that sometimes fails and others as tests that are not ready to be run with your suite (related features aren't done yet). Run all the other tests.
