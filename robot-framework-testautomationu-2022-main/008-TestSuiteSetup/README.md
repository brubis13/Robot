# Test Suite Setup

## Purpose:

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how setup is done for a test suite in Robot Framework

## Learning Objectives:

- Trainees will state the area of the test suite used for setting up the test case suite
- Trainees will identify suite setup as the “Arrange” step from the AAA paradigm
- Trainees will demonstrate their test suite calling a keyword as a part of the Suite Setup

## Challenge:

Manage test suite set up by calling an existing keyword (5 min)

**Extra Credit:** Create a second test and call the comment keyword at the beginning of 
each test case using a concept similar to suite setup.
