# Project Setup

## Purpose:
The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that everyone has access to the project examples and source code. Ensure python 3.8, pip, chromedriver, chrome, git, and robot framework are installed properly.

## Learning Objectives:

- Trainees will demonstrate that they have python, pip, chromedriver, chrome, git, and robotframework installed correctly.

## Challenge:
Complete project setup.

### Project Setup

Before starting the install process, check to see what is already installed. At command line type to verify tool installation:

```
git version
python --version
robot --version
pip --version
chromedriver --version
```


#### Install Tools:
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Install python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- [Install Robot Framework 4.0 or greater](https://pypi.org/project/robotframework/)
- [Install SeleniumLibrary and WebDrivers](http://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/)
- [Install Robot Framework RequestsLibrary](https://pypi.org/project/robotframework-requests/)



#### Updating chromedriver:

```
webdrivermanager update chrome  
```

##### Optional Tools:
You'll need an IDE, here are some to choose from
- [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Install Atom](https://atom.io/)

Some extensions for VSCode that may be useful
```
